I would like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to have this job. 
If it were not for the support I had I would not have achieved the amount of work that I have accomplished.
I would like to thank my Mother and my Father for all that they have given me.
I would like to humbly thank you for this prestigious position.
The many tireless hours I have worked is truly tremendous.
Day in and day out, I have strived never to let any of my fellow coworkers down.
